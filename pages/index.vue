        Finally took that leap and signed up for pottery classes! The studio has this amazing
        earthy smell - clay
        dust
        and coffee from the caf√© next door. My first attempt at making a bowl looked more like a wonky ashtray, but my
        instructor Sarah said that's totally normal. There's something so therapeutic about feeling the clay move
        between your fingers, even when it's not quite doing what you want it to.

        On my way home, I stopped by that new bookstore on Oak Street. Found this incredible book on urban foraging of
        all things! Who knew there were edible plants growing all over the city? Already planning to try identifying
        some this weekend at the park. Think I'll bring Maya along - she's always up for my random adventures, even if
        they end with us eating weeds. At least we'll have a good story to tell at Sunday brunch.
