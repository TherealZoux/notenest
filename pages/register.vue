        <p class="w-[30rem]"> Finally took that leap and signed up for pottery classes! The studio has this amazing
          earthy smell - clay
          dust
          and coffee from the caf√© next door. My first attempt at making a bowl looked more like a wonky ashtray, but my
          instructor Sarah said that's totally normal. There's something so therapeutic about feeling the clay move
          between your fingers, even when it's not quite doing what you want it to.

          On my way home, I stopped by that new bookstore on Oak Street. Found this incredible book on urban foraging of
          all things! Who knew there were edible plants growing all over the city? Already planning to try identifying
          some this weekend at the park. Think I'll bring Maya along - she's always up for my random adventures, even if
          they end with us eating weeds. At least we'll have a good story to tell at Sunday brunch.
